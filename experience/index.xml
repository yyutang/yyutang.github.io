      <description>Traffic Sign Recognition Abstract: Traffic Sign Recognition is to recognize and identify the traffic signs in Canada. The project needs to deal with image processing (shape and color processing) and image recognition (text and symbol recognition). The project delivers two segmentation programs that find the road sign in the image by colors and contours. After segments, a matching program is performed to compute the similarity with the dataset and present final recognition result.</description>
